# Fotopx

### About

 This is the live  *[Fotopx site](https://fotopx.herokuapp.com/#/)*.
 
 This site is a showcase of my fullstack development skills as well as my own photography. It is a clone of *[500px](https://500px.com/)*.
 
 ### Current Features
 
 Fotopx uses a custom user auth and allows login and logout functionality. The site features a demo user login to test out the site as well as a demo user page to view their profile picture and header image.
 
 - The home page features a custom SVG styled after the 500px home page.
 - I took the photo of the cow in Rishikesh, India
