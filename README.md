# Fotopx

### About

 This is the live  *[Fotopx site](https://fotopx.herokuapp.com/#/)*.
 
 This site is my final project for App Academy, and a clone of *[500px](https://500px.com/)*.
 
 ### Current Features
 
 Fotopx uses a custom user auth and allows login and logout functionality. The site features a demo user login to test out the site as well as a demo user page to view their profile picture and header image.
